For my .val() input in the newEmp array (line 38), I made it so that only a number could be entered and the $ would be automatically entered in the table (line 92). But if the user enters a $ in the form, then the table returns NaN. Hwo can I make the input remove the $ if it is entered? Or, when the input is selected, have the $ prefilled?

I used an if statement to determine if the background color the total monthly cost should be red or not (line 69), but I had to put it in the function that calculated the monthly cost. I thought it should have gone in the render function, and I'm having trouble logic-ing why it does not work there.
